Pandas is a powerful and popular Python library designed for data manipulation and data analysis.

Series - A one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type. Each item in the series has a unique index.
       - It is used to track changes or patterns over time.

DataFrame - A two-dimensional labelled data structure.
          - It consists of rows and columns where rows has indices and cols has names.

encoding - utf-8
         - latin1

If the data is stored over the google cloud then we could use a library name (gcsfs) to read data directly from there.

For dealing with the rows of the data .. there are 2 methods 
1. head(n) -- from top 
2. tail(n) -- from bottom 
.. here n is the number of rows 

If we do not provide the value of n then it will give 5 rows by default.


info() method
1. It gives number of rows and columns of the DataFrame
2. It will give column names
3. will provide data types
4. non null counts
5. memory usuage of the DataFrame


describe() method 
it is used for providing the summary of the dataframe 

shape is used for getting the number of rows and columns -- it return tuple
